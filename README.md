# Platformer Game made with Raylib
### This repo is intended to be a template that anyone could use to start making a basic platformer game. It uses raylib as its base graphics library, and Ferox as its physics engine. for level management, Tiled-2D is implemented as it's easy to import and export levels with collision borders.

##The original game was made for the raylib 5k gamejam and can be played here [a link](https://armando-orozco.itch.io/tiempo-muerto)
