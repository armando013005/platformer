Copy them into your game folder.

## Setup your game's source code
Make a folder for your actual game’s source code. In this case we will be starting with the “advanced game” template from the raylib sources, since it is a great place to start any project from. Be sure to copy at least one C or CPP file that has a main function into this folder. If you are unsure what to do , simply copy the code from one of the examples.

## Setup premake5.lua file
Open the premake5.lua file in notepad++ or some other text editor (regular notepad is fine).
Find the two instances of “YourGame” and replace them with the name of your game project.

Save the file and close it.

## Run premake-2019.bat
Double click the premake-2019.bat file, or run it from a console. This will generate all the visual studio project files for the game. You will end up with a .sln file for your game in the root folder.

The same premake system can be used on linux, just use the command premake5 gmake instead of premake5 vs2019

## Open your .sln file
Double click the sln file to open your game project in Visual Studio. It will include both your game files and the raylib library, all ready to build.
